## Challenge

During the [Steel City Codefest](http://www.steelcitycodefest.com/) my team and I were challenged by [Phipps Conservatory](https://www.phipps.conservatory.org/?gclid=CjwKEAjwrO_MBRDxgqLa-LX041QSJABgmcMsPTC4s17vPuI_MAgTNgdb350DcUlu8m7BEbDMnBCcahoCUzHw_wcB) to create a fun and interactive application in which parents could sit down with the kids and log different things such as 
* Number of servings of Fruits and Vegetables per day
* Hours spent in watching/playing tv, ipad, video games, etc
* Hours of physical activity
* Number of sugary drinks/ cups of water

We had one week to come up with a prototype
