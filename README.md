## About
In 2015, Let's Move Pittsburgh (LMP) launched a [5-2-1-0](http://phipps.conservatory.org/lets-move-pittsburgh/our-programs/5-2-1-0) initiative that reinforces four healthy habits for kids: 5 servings of fruits and veggies, 2 hours or less of recreational screen time, 1 hour of more of physical activity and 0 sugary drinks- every day. Let's Move Pittsburgh promotes the 5-2-1-0 message through a media campaign and coordinates healthy programs at early learning centers, schools, out of school sites and healthcare practices to make it easier for kids to practice 5-2-1-0. The team at Let's Move Pittsburgh envisions a tracker app designed for kids and focus on positive ways to make it easy and fun to adopt a healthy lifestyle.

## Challenge

During the [Steel City Codefest](http://www.steelcitycodefest.com/) my team and I were challenged by [Phipps Conservatory](https://www.phipps.conservatory.org/?gclid=CjwKEAjwrO_MBRDxgqLa-LX041QSJABgmcMsPTC4s17vPuI_MAgTNgdb350DcUlu8m7BEbDMnBCcahoCUzHw_wcB) to create a fun and interactive application in which parents could sit down with the kids and log different things such as 
* Number of servings of Fruits and Vegetables per day
* Hours spent in watching/playing tv, ipad, video games, etc
* Hours of physical activity
* Number of sugary drinks/ cups of water

We had one week to come up with a prototype
